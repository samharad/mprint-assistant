# TODO

Think about:
- Find nearby printers
- Look for authentication in browser cookies
- Alias "favorite" printers
- Super quick flag that selects "primary" bank of printers from the queue menu; would not work in East Hall basement...
- Better interactive display system, so not left with a terminal full of output
- Support regex, or at least wildcard
